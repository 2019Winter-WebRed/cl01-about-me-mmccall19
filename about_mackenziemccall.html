        <h1> About Me</h1>
        <hr/> 
            <!-- this paragraph gives background information about me-->
        <p>My name is Mackenzie McCall. I was born August 10, 2001 in Delaware. I have two sisters and two parents, they are really cool and get me through my days. I am currently a senior in a high school for girls called Padua Academy which is very important to me. I also have a job at an inflatible party place called Pump It Up, which is a fun environment to work in. My friends at school and at work brighten my moods and help me look forward to my responsibilities. I try to maintain a positive attitude at all times, even in the most challenging situations. School and work are the most important to me but  I live a pretty normal life, in an average state, with amazing friends and family! Staying positive and strong can be difficult for someone my age therefore, one of my favorite quotes to live by is: </p>
            <blockquote> "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me." </blockquote> 
        
        <h3> What I like to do</h3>
            <!--this paragraph gives information about my hobbies and interests--> 
            <p1> I do not have a lot of free time between school and work but when I do there is a number of activities I enjoy participating in. In the summer, I enjoy waterskiing and wakeboarding. Not to brag, but I'm pretty good at it too. In the fall, I like to go to orchards and do autumn activities with my friends. I do not like winter so I tend to stay inside most of the season. In the spring, I like going outside and enjoying the fresh air, especially after being in hibernation all winter. On the normal weekend (after work) you can catch me hanging out with friends. Even when I'm busy, I find things that I like to do. While doing schoolwork I'll listen to music or watch Netflix. One of my favorite movies to watch on Netflix is <i> What's Eating Gilbert Grape </i> starring Leo DiCaprio and Johnny Depp. I also enjoy speaking Spanish, which makes some parts of school and homework fun! Another thing I do is watch Youtube. Some of my favorite YouTubers are <b> Cody Ko </b>, <b> Noel Miller</b>, and <b> Kurtis Conner</b>. I don't normally read books but one of my favorite books is either <i> Rebecca </i> or <i> The Importance of Being Earnest</i>. All in all I enjoy doing what most teenage girls do, spending time cherishing every moment I have with friends and family.  </p1>
        
        <h3> What I want to be</h3>
            <!-- This paragraph gives insight to my plans for the future--> 
            <p1> For the longest time I wanted to be an anesthesiologist, however I came to realize that I cannot physically handle the responsibility that an anesthesiologist has. I still wanted to have a job in the medical field, just not so hands-on. I discovered pharmacy and quickly realized that it was the career for me. I am going to be attending University of the Sciences next fall and am enrolled in their PharmD program. I am super excited to be working with medicine and seeing their effects, negative and positive. The drug epidemic is only worsening, especially in Delaware, and I hope that I can have an impact in preventing opioid addiction in the lives of those whom it might concern. </p1>
        
        <h3> My Favorite Music</h3>
            <!-- this paragraph talks about one of my favorite things: music-->
            <p1> Music is everywhere and plays a big role in my day-to-day life. Music can effect your mood and motivation. I listen to music ranging from classical to EDM depending on my mood or what I'm doing. I also <b> LOVE </b> 80s music. My favorite group is Hall and Oates! Normally though, I listen to modern hip-hop and rap. But sometimes I listen to dance music. What I listen to depends on who else is listening, what kind of music mood I'm in and whatever task is at hand. Although I listen to music almost all of the time, I do not enjoy concerts. When I was younger I had in interest in making music, I even took up playing piano and got a mixer for my birthday! One of my favorite songs is <q> Break My Stride </q> by Matthew Wilder, it always puts me in a good mood and raises my spirits! </p1>
